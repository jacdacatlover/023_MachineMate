      "Sit on the machine with your back flat against the padded support",
      "Place your feet on the footplate shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward",
      "Adjust the seat position so your knees are at about 90 degrees when starting",

      "Release the safety locks on either side once you're in position"
    ],
    "howToSteps": [
      "Press through your heels to extend your legs, pushing the platform away",
      "Stop just before your knees fully lock out (keep a slight bend)",
      "Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees",
      "Control the descent until your knees return to about 90 degrees",

    "commonMistakes": [
      "Locking knees completely at the top of the movement",
      "Letting knees cave inward instead of tracking over toes",

    "beginnerTips": [
      "Focus on controlled movement rather than heavy weight",
      "Breathe out as you press, breathe in as you lower",
      "Keep your core engaged to protect your lower back",
