# Test Machine Photos

This folder should contain sample photos of gym machines for testing the camera identification feature.

## Required Photos

Add sample photos for each of the 5 seed machines:

1. `leg_press.jpg` - Photo of a leg press machine
2. `lat_pulldown.jpg` - Photo of a lat pulldown machine
3. `chest_press.jpg` - Photo of a chest press machine
4. `seated_row.jpg` - Photo of a seated cable row machine
5. `shoulder_press.jpg` - Photo of a shoulder press machine

## Where to Get Photos

### Option 1: Take Your Own Photos (Recommended)
- Visit your local gym
- Take photos of each machine from a user's perspective
- Make sure the full machine is visible in the frame
- Take in good lighting

### Option 2: Online Image Search
Search for these machines on:
- Google Images (use "labeled for reuse" filter)
- Unsplash, Pexels (free stock photos)
- Equipment manufacturer websites (e.g., Life Fitness, Hammer Strength)

Example search terms:
- "leg press machine gym"
- "lat pulldown machine"
- "chest press machine"
- "seated cable row machine"
- "shoulder press machine"

### Option 3: Stock Photos
- Purchase from stock photo sites
- Look for "gym equipment" collections

## Image Specifications

- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 1080x1920px (portrait) or 1920x1080px (landscape)
- Quality: High resolution, clear view of the machine
- Lighting: Well-lit, minimal shadows

## How to Test

1. Place photos in this folder
2. Run the app on your device or simulator
3. From the Home screen, tap "Identify a Machine"
4. On a real device: Point camera at a machine and take a photo
5. On a simulator: You can use these test photos by:
   - Dragging them into the simulator
   - Selecting from the simulator's photo library

## For MVP Testing

The camera will work without these test photos. However, having reference images helps you test the identification flow without needing to be at a gym.
